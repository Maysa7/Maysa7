## Featured Projects
- [**Odin Recipes**](https://github.com/Maysa7/odin_recipes)
Created a responsive recipe website using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** as part of The Odin Project curriculum. Focused on clean UI design and performance optimization by implementing reusable components and structured CSS for scalability. Added interactive navigation and animations to improve user experience. Deployed the project on **GitHub Pages** to practice version control and public hosting, strengthening front-end development and deployment workflows.  

- **Database Management Project**
Designed and implemented a full relational database system in **SQL** for a simulated university course project. Built normalized schemas, applied **indexing and stored procedures**, and created **Entity-Relationship (ER) diagrams** to model complex relationships. Wrote and optimized queries for faster performance, applying data integrity constraints and referential checks. This project enhanced my skills in **database architecture, query optimization, and real-world problem solving** for large datasets.

- **Data Mining Project**
Developed a **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier** in **Python** that achieved 85% classification accuracy. Cleaned and preprocessed raw datasets using **Pandas/NumPy**, applied feature scaling, and visualized trends with **Matplotlib**. Conducted **cross-validation** to evaluate model performance and adjusted hyperparameters to improve accuracy. This project gave me hands-on experience with **machine learning pipelines, data wrangling, and model validation techniques**.

- **Drone Programming Lab (GMU Certification)**
Completed a structured training program in **autonomous drone programming** at George Mason University. Used onboard sensors and programming logic to perform navigation tasks and obstacle avoidance. Gained exposure to **embedded systems, robotics principles, and applied AI concepts**, reinforcing my interest in hardware-software integration.  

## Education & Certifications
- **B.S. Computer Science, George Mason University** – *Expected May 2026*  
- **Drone Program Certification, GMU** – *Issued June 2025*  
- **CompTIA Security+** – *In Progress*
